# grid-css

I like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), so I use it for all the project I do.

So when "someone" starts with a I-am-a-frontend-developer-and-I-never-use-a-framework-bullshit.css, I quickly miss stuff that I need.

In this case I missed a grid. I wanted to copy paste something quick, but I noticed that I really don't know anything about flexbox. This is a great oppertunity to find out.
